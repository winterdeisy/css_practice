            Tomáš's mistress and closest friend. 
            Sabina lives her life as an extreme example of lightness, 
            taking profound satisfaction in the act of betrayal. 
            She declares war on kitsch and struggles against the constraints imposed upon 
            her by her puritan ancestry and the Communist Party. 
            This struggle is shown through her paintings. She occasionally expresses excitement at humiliation, 
            as shown through the use of her grandfather's bowler hat, 
            a symbol that is born during one sexual encounter with Tomáš, 
            before it eventually changes meaning and becomes a relic of the past. Later in the novel, 
            she begins to correspond with Šimon while living under the roof of some older Americans 
            who admire her artistic skill.
